# timecard_reports
Since this is my first repository and I'm learning how to use it, I'm using an old macro I used to run to organize and process timecards for payroll purposes. 

It uncludes sending an email with a macro using a Gmail account with different attachments, time tracker, variable rows, conditionals, pivot tables.
